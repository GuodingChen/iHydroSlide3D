# iHydroSlide3D v1.1
#### ✅ What is iHydroSlide3D v1.1?

iHydroSlide3D is an open-source, **p**arallelized, and modular modeling software for regional **hy**drologic processes and **l**andslides simulation and prediction. The PHyL mainly includes the following modules: (i) a distributed hydrological model (CREST); (ii) a regional 3D slope stability model; and (iii) a soil moisture downscaling (SMD) method. Parallel computational technique is applied for both hydrological and slope-stability modeling modules, which is further seamlessly coupled by the SMD method. An advanced storage method, visualization, and validation processes are designed to improve the post-processing of the simulation results. PHyL is therefore an advanced and user-friendly tool for regional flood-landslide disaster forecasting.

Note:  *iHydroSlide3D v1.1* is functionally identical to *PHyL v1.0* (Chen et al., 2024), which was developed as an enhanced version of *iHydroSlide3D v1.0*, primarily improving high-performance computing (HPC) capabilities. Although *PHyL v1.0* was publicly released, we have decided to discontinue that name. All future updates and releases will continue under the name *iHydroSlide3D*, which is already well established and widely recognized in the open-source community.
